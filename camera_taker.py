camera_taker.py

A utility script to capture live parking spot images from a webcam,
label them as 'empty' or 'occupied', and save both the full-frame
and cropped ROI images into organized folders.

Usage:
    1. Run the script: python camera_taker.py
    2. A live video window will open with a yellow rectangle indicating
       the crop area.
    3. Press 'E' to label the current frame as EMPTY.
    4. Press 'O' to label the current frame as OCCUPIED.
    5. Press 'Q' to quit the application.
